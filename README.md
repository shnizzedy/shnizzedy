### My work hours:
<!-- *Are you a morning person? Or a night owl? When should someone expect to work with you? When will I be unavailable?* -->

I <span title="struggle">strive</span> to maintain a healthy work-life balance. In service of that effort, for my primary employment I try to be:

* fully available 9 AM ‒ 5 PM ([America/New_York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones)) on workdays (typically Monday ‒ Friday) with approximately a 30 minute lunch break at some point
* fully unavailable outside those hours, during lunch, weekends, and days off

### What’s the best way to communicate with me?
<!-- *Prefer Slack over email on certain topics? Prefer in-person meetings over chats? Is it OK to interrupt when I have headphones on?* -->

I'm a bit hard of hearing and a bit of a stutterer, so I prefer written to spoken communication. I check the following in order of frequency:

1. [![Slack](https://cdn.brandfolder.io/5H442O3W/at/pl546j-7le8zk-6gwiyo/Slack_Mark.png?width=12&height=12) CMI-CNL Slack](cmi-cnl.slack.com)
2. ![Credo Mobile](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/19/CREDO_Mobile_logo.svg/37px-CREDO_Mobile_logo.svg.png) text messages
3. <img src="https://outlook.office.com/mail/favicon.ico" alt="Outlook" style="height:12px;"> work (`@childmind.org`) email

2. reaching out to someone else relevant to the question / project
